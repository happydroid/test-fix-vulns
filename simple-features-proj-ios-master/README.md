### About ###

[Simple Features Projection](http://ngageoint.github.io/simple-features-proj-ios/) is an iOS library for performing projection conversions between [Simple Feature](https://github.com/ngageoint/simple-features-ios) Geometries.

#### Transform ####

```objectivec

// SFGeometry *geometry = ...

PROJProjection *projection1 =
    [PROJProjectionFactory projectionWithAuthority:PROJ_AUTHORITY_EPSG
    andIntCode:PROJ_EPSG_WEB_MERCATOR];
PROJProjection *projection2 =
    [PROJProjectionFactory projectionWithAuthority:PROJ_AUTHORITY_EPSG
    andIntCode:PROJ_EPSG_WORLD_GEODETIC_SYSTEM];

SFPGeometryTransform *transform =
    [SFPGeometryTransform transformFromProjection:projection1
    andToProjection:projection2];

SFGeometry *transformed = [transform transformGeometry:geometry];

```

#### Transform ####

```swift

// var geometry: SFGeometry = ...

let projection1: PROJProjection = PROJProjectionFactory.projection(withAuthority: PROJ_AUTHORITY_EPSG, andIntCode: PROJ_EPSG_WEB_MERCATOR)
let projection2: PROJProjection = PROJProjectionFactory.projection(withAuthority: PROJ_AUTHORITY_EPSG, andIntCode: PROJ_EPSG_WORLD_GEODETIC_SYSTEM)

let transform: SFPGeometryTransform = SFPGeometryTransform(from: projection1, andTo: projection2)

let transformed: SFGeometry = transform.transform(geometry)

```
